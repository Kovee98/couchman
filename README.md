# Couchman [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Kovee98/couchman.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/Kovee98/couchman)
> A multi-instance CouchDB manager with filtering, sorting, and a simple view system. Meant to be simple, intuitive, and persistent.

This project set out to accomplish a handful of core features:
- Multi-instance switching for easier management of multiple servers
- Filtering/sorting to make document management a breeze
- A simple view system that's quick and intuitive

## Security
**IMPORTANT:** As of now, Couchman stores everything in IndexDB stores as plain text. **Including passwords**. Couchman is not responsible for compromised passwords and/or subsequent data. A better and more secure approach to this is being researched and will hopefully be released in a future version of Couchman soon. Stay tooned!
