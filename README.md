# Couchman
> A multi-instance CouchDB manager with filtering, sorting, and a simple view system. Meant to be simple, intuitive, and persistent.

This project set out to accomplish a handful of core features:
- Switching between multiple instances for easier management
- Filtering/sorting to make document management as easy as possible
- A simple view system that's intuitive to use

## Security
**IMPORTANT:** As of now, Couchman stores everything in IndexDB stores as plain text. **Including passwords**. Couchman is not responsible for compromised passwords and/or subsequent data. A better and more secure approach to this is being researched and will hopefully be released in a future version of Couchman soon. Stay tooned!
